## Sprint 1 — Splash + Intro Cinematic
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` | NEW | Navy bg, RAWI/راوي logo fade-in with staggered timing (logo 0-60%, bismillah 40-100%). Auto-navigates: 2s hold for first launch → intro cinematic, 1s for returning → hub. Fade transition (600ms). |
| `lib/screens/intro_cinematic_screen.dart` | NEW | Full-screen `scene_welcome.jpg` with dark gradient overlay. 5 sequential bilingual text lines, each: 600ms fade-in → 1800ms hold → 400ms fade-out. Lines: "570 CE" → "The Arabian Peninsula..." → "A world waiting for a message" → "You are the Rawi" → "Witness history. Carry the story." Skip button (top-right). "Begin" CTA fades in at end. |
| `lib/services/prefs_service.dart` | MODIFIED | Added 7 new keys: `onboardingComplete` (bool), `userName` (String), `userGender` (String: male/female), `musicEnabled` (bool), `voEnabled` (bool), `sfxEnabled` (bool). Added `isAr` helper getter. |
| `lib/main.dart` | MODIFIED | Entry point now always routes to `SplashScreen`. Removed `WelcomeScreen` and `AerialHubScreen` imports from main. |

### Flow After Sprint 1
```
First launch:  App → SplashScreen (2s) → IntroCinematicScreen → "Begin" → Hub
Returning:     App → SplashScreen (1s) → Hub
```

### Quality
- `flutter analyze` — zero issues
- Package name updated to `com.rawi.journey` (build.gradle.kts + MainActivity.kt)

## Sprint 2 — Registration Flow
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/registration_screen.dart` | NEW | 4-step horizontal PageView with dot indicators. Step 1: Name input (optional, gold underline, skip button). Step 2: Gender selection (two circular image cards — `companion_male.jpg`/`companion_female.jpg` — with gold border, scale animation, glow on selected). Step 3: Language (English/العربية cards with flags). Step 4: Milestone preview (4 cards migrated from welcome_screen, M1 active, M2-M4 locked with lock icon). "Start the Journey" CTA saves all prefs and navigates to hub. |
| `lib/screens/intro_cinematic_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | "Begin" and "Skip" now navigate to `RegistrationScreen` instead of hub. Removed `setOnboardingComplete()` call — registration handles it. Removed TODO comments. |
| `lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart` | DELETED | Fully replaced by splash + intro + registration flow. Milestone card design migrated to registration step 4. |

### Flow After Sprint 2
```
First launch:  App → Splash (2s) → Intro Cinematic → Registration (4 steps) → Hub
Returning:     App → Splash (1s) → Hub
```

### Registration Steps
```
Step 1: Name     → "What shall we call you, traveler?" (optional, skip)
Step 2: Gender   → Two circular avatar cards (male/female JPG images)
Step 3: Language → English 🇬🇧 / العربية 🇸🇦 cards
Step 4: Milestones → 4 chapter cards → "Start the Journey" CTA
```

### Data Saved on Completion
- `userName` → SharedPreferences (if entered)
- `userGender` → 'male' or 'female'
- `language` → 'en' or 'ar'
- `onboardingComplete` → true

### Quality

## Sprint 3 — Settings (Overlay + Screen)
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|

Save & Exit button (pops to hub). Resume button (gold, closes overlay). All toggles persist to SharedPreferences immediately. |
| `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` | NEW | Full-page settings from hub. Sections: Audio (3 toggles), Profile (language cycle, companion gender cycle, name display), Journey (XP, streak, reset with confirmation dialog), About (logo + version + tagline). Back arrow returns to hub. Bilingual labels throughout. |
| `lib/screens/aerial_hub_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Added ⚙️ gear icon (circle, 34px) after XP badge in top bar. Taps → fades out ambient → pushes SettingsScreen → on return: refreshes state + restarts ambient if music enabled. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `_showSettings` state bool. Added ⚙️ gear icon (circle, 32px) after language toggle in top bar. `_openSettings()`: stops game loop + audio, shows overlay. `_resumeFromSettings()`: hides overlay, syncs `_isAr` from prefs, restarts ambient if enabled. `_saveAndExit()`: pops to hub. SettingsOverlay rendered as top-level Stack child. |
| `lib/services/audio_service.dart` | MODIFIED | `playAmbient()` checks `PrefsService.musicEnabled` — returns early if false. `playSfx()` checks `PrefsService.sfxEnabled` — returns early if false. Added `prefs_service.dart` import. |

### Settings Access Points
```
From Hub:     ⚙️ top-right → SettingsScreen (full page)
During Game:  ⚙️ top-right → SettingsOverlay (pause overlay)
```

### Toggle Behavior

## Sprint 4 — Image-Based Companion
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/companion_figure.dart` | REWRITTEN | Replaced 255-line CustomPainter bust (head, keffiyeh, shoulders, eyes, beard) with image-based circular avatar. Loads `companion_male.jpg` or `companion_female.jpg` based on `PrefsService.userGender`. 60px diameter ClipOval with 2px gold border. Animated golden aura glow (BoxShadow pulsing with animation). Walking bob + breathing + lean animations applied via `Transform.translate` on the container. "You"/"أنت" label below. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Adjusted companion positioning offset from (-22, -31) to (-32, -41) to account for larger circle (60px vs old 44px bust). |

### Before → After
```
Before: CustomPainter draws head, keffiyeh, agal, eyes, beard, shoulders, neck (255 lines)
After:  ClipOval + Image.asset inside gold-bordered circle (130 lines)
```

### Same Interface Preserved
- `isWalking` — walking bob animation
- `facingDirection` — lean during movement
- `isAr` — "You"/"أنت" label language

### Gender Reactivity
- Reads `PrefsService.userGender` on each build
- Changes take effect on next event load (no hot-reload needed mid-scene)

### Quality
- `flutter analyze` — zero errors/warnings

## Sprint 5 — Hotspot System Overhaul
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/scene_hotspot_marker.dart` | REWRITTEN | Replaced circular marker with diamond shape (rotated 45° square, `borderRadius: 4`). Three states: `active` (pulsing diamond + glow — next to discover), `discovered` (dimmed diamond + green tick badge), hidden (not rendered). New `active` bool parameter. Icon stays upright inside rotated container. Pulse ring also diamond-shaped. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **Progressive reveal:** Added `_pendingDiscovery` set (found but panel not yet dismissed). Hotspot rendering now filters: only show discovered + pending + next undiscovered hotspot. All shown in choose phase. **Green tick fix:** `_discovered.add()` moved from `_activateHotspot`/`_onHotspotTap` to `_dismissPanel`. Tick only appears after panel dismiss. **Centered card:** Changed `centerMode: _activeHotspot!.id == 'kaabah'` to `centerMode: true` — all hotspots use centered card. Updated `discoveredCount` and progress to include pending. |

### Behavior Change Summary
| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Hotspot shape | Circle (40px) | Diamond (rotated 36px square) |
| Visibility | All hotspots visible from start | Only completed + next one visible (progressive) |
| Green tick | Appears on proximity (auto-discovery) | Appears after user dismisses panel |
| Card mode | Only Ka'bah centered, others bottom panel | All hotspots use centered card |
| Pulse animation | All undiscovered pulse | Only the active (next) hotspot pulses |

### State Machine
```
Hidden → Active (next to discover, pulsing)
  → Pending (found, panel open, no tick yet)
  → Discovered (panel dismissed, green tick shown)
```

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/cinematic_transition_screen.dart` | NEW | Fade-to-black + title card transition. Flow: black overlay fades in (400ms) → title card fades in (400ms) showing year CE, location, event title in Cinzel gold → hold 2s → title fades out (400ms) → 200ms pause → `onComplete` callback. Bilingual. Decorative gold line separator. |
| `lib/screens/aerial_hub_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | `_openEvent` now pushes `CinematicTransitionScreen` first (opaque: false, instant). On completion, `pushReplacement` swaps to event screen. Also respects `musicEnabled` on return. |

### Transition Flow
```
Hub → tap event → audio fades
  → black fills screen (400ms)
  → title card: "570 CE / Mecca / Arabia Before the Light" (2s)
  → title fades (400ms)
  → pushReplacement → event screen

## Sprint 11 — Edge TTS Voice Over
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `tools/generate_vo.py` | NEW | Python batch generator using `edge-tts`. 12 fragment texts (4 per event x 3 events) x 4 voice variants (en_m, en_f, ar_m, ar_f) = 48 VO files. 13 companion lines x 4 variants = 52 companion clips. Total: 100 MP3 files. Batched in groups of 10 to avoid rate limiting. Skips existing files. |
| `assets/audio/vo/` | NEW | 48 MP3 files. Naming: `vo_{eventKey}_{hotspotId}_{lang}_{gender}.mp3`. |
| `assets/audio/companion/` | NEW | 52 MP3 files. Naming: `comp_{lineId}_{lang}_{gender}.mp3`. |
| `lib/services/audio_service.dart` | MODIFIED | Added Layer 2 (VO): `_vo` AudioPlayer, `playVoiceover()` with ambient ducking (0.25 → 0.08 during VO), `fadeOutVoiceover()` (500ms fade), `stopVoiceover()`. Respects `PrefsService.voEnabled`. Auto-restores ambient volume when VO completes. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `_voPath()` — derives VO asset path from event ID + hotspot ID + language + gender. `_playVoForHotspot()` — plays VO 300ms after panel opens. Wired into `_activateHotspot()` and `_onHotspotTap()`. `_dismissPanel()` calls `fadeOutVoiceover()`. `_openSettings()` calls `stopVoiceover()`. |
| `pubspec.yaml` | MODIFIED | Added `assets/audio/vo/` and `assets/audio/companion/` to asset declarations. |

### Voice Pairs
| Gender | Arabic | English |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Male | `ar-JO-TaimNeural` (Jordanian) | `en-GB-RyanNeural` (British) |
| Female | `ar-JO-SanaNeural` (Jordanian) | `en-GB-SoniaNeural` (British) |

### Audio Layer Architecture
```
Layer 1: Ambient (looping)     — 0.25 vol (ducks to 0.08 during VO)
Layer 2: Voice Over (one-shot) — 0.70 vol, 300ms delay after panel open
Layer 3: SFX (one-shot)        — 0.40 vol on hotspot discovery
```

### VO Flow
```
Panel opens → 300ms delay → VO starts → ambient ducks
  → user dismisses panel → VO fades out (500ms) → ambient restores
  → or VO finishes naturally → ambient restores automatically
```

### Asset Count (Final)
- Fragment VO: 48 MP3 (12 fragments x 4 variants)
- Companion VO: 52 MP3 (13 lines x 4 variants)
- SFX: 14 WAV (1 ambient + 13 SFX)
- Images: 17 JPG (3 scene + 13 bubble + 1 welcome) + 2 figures + 1 icon

## Sprint 12 — Critical Fixes (R1-01, R1-02, R1-03)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R1-01 (figure freeze), R1-02 (auto-move), R1-03 (VO leak)

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-01 freeze fix:** `didChangeAppLifecycleState` now fully resets on pause: stops game loop, resets controller to 0, zeros joystick input, cancels idle timer, sets walking=false. On resume: restarts ambient (if enabled) and idle timer. **R1-02 auto-move fix:** Changed `_gameLoop.forward()` to `_gameLoop.repeat()` in joystick `onMove` — loop now repeats indefinitely while held. Added `_gameLoop.reset()` in `onRelease` — fully stops and resets to 0. Also added reset in `_openSettings`. **R1-03 VO leak fix:** Added `AudioService.stopVoiceover()` to `didChangeAppLifecycleState` pause handler. VO now stops when app is backgrounded. |

### Root Causes
| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| R1-01 freeze | `AnimationController.forward()` with 100s duration — once completed (value=1.0), calling forward again is a no-op. After app pause/resume, controller stuck at last value. | Reset to 0 on pause. Use `repeat()` instead of `forward()`. |
| R1-02 auto-move | Same `forward()` issue — loop kept ticking through 100s even after joystick release in edge cases. Race between `stop()` and frame callbacks. | `repeat()` + `reset()` on release. Joystick values zeroed. |
| R1-03 VO leak | `didChangeAppLifecycleState` only stopped ambient + SFX, not the VO player. | Added `stopVoiceover()` to pause handler. |

## Sprint 13 — Hotspot Visibility UX Change (R1-04)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R1-04

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/scene_hotspot_marker.dart` | REWRITTEN | Added `locked` state (4th visual state). Locked: 35% opacity, muted diamond border, smaller icon (14px, white38), lock icon badge (top-right), dimmed label. `onTap` is null when locked (not tappable). |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Removed `.where()` filter — all hotspots now rendered. Each gets state: `discovered` (tick), `active` (pulsing, next), `locked` (dimmed, untappable), or pending (panel open). |

### Visual States
```
🔒 Locked   — dimmed 35% opacity, muted border, lock badge, not tappable
💎 Active   — pulsing gold diamond, glow, tappable (next to discover)
📋 Pending  — found but panel still open, no tick yet
✅ Discovered — dimmed diamond, green tick badge, re-tappable
```

### Before → After
```
Before: Only show completed + next hotspot. Rest hidden.
After:  ALL 4 hotspots visible from start. Locked ones dimmed with 🔒.
        Player sees the full map of what's ahead.

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R1-09, R1-10, R1-11, R1-12, R1-13, R1-14

### Built
| File | Type | Fix |
|------|------|-----|
| `lib/screens/registration_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-09:** Restructured `_GenderCard` — moved label Text outside the circular AnimatedContainer. Circle now only wraps the ClipOval image. Label sits below independently. |
| `tools/generate_vo.py` | MODIFIED | **R1-10:** Changed Arabic voices from `ar-JO-TaimNeural`/`ar-JO-SanaNeural` to `ar-SY-LaithNeural`/`ar-SY-AmanyNeural` (Syrian — closest to Palestinian). **R1-14:** Updated all 12 fragments to match full text from scene_configs.dart (missing last sentences added). |
| `assets/audio/vo/` | REGENERATED | All 48 fragment VO files regenerated with full text + Syrian Arabic voices. |
| `assets/audio/companion/` | REGENERATED | All 26 Arabic companion clips regenerated with Syrian voices. |
| `lib/data/companion_dialogue.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-11:** Added `id` field to `DialogueLine`. Added `getId()` static method. All lines now have IDs matching companion VO filenames. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-11:** Added `_companionVoPath()` helper. All 5 `_showBubble()` call sites now pass `voPath` — idle, revisit warn/firm, post-discovery, all-done. **R1-12:** Moved discovery progress from `bottom: 180` to `top: topPad + 52` (below era bar). |
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/discovery_panel.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-13:** Changed centered card image from `BoxFit.cover` + `height: 160` to `BoxFit.contain` + `maxHeight: 180` via ConstrainedBox. Images no longer crop. |

## Sprint 15 — Hub Redesign + Post-Event Flow (R1-05 to R1-08)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R1-05, R1-06, R1-07, R1-08

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/event_list_screen.dart` | NEW | **R1-05:** Replaces parallax hub. RAWI header with progress badge (X/36), XP badge, settings gear. Scrollable ListView of all 36 events. Each card shows: event number (circle), title (bilingual RTL), location + year, status badge. States: completed (green check + X/X hotspots), next (highlighted border + glow + "Play" badge), locked (40% opacity + lock icon). Tapping completed/next opens cinematic transition → event. Cinematic transition + audio management carried over from old hub. |
| `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-08:** Now navigates to `EventListScreen` instead of `AerialHubScreen`. |
| `lib/screens/registration_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Same — navigates to `EventListScreen` after onboarding. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-06:** `_continue()` simplified — always pops back to event list. Removed `_didCompleteEra()` and `EraCompleteScreen` routing. Removed unused `era_complete_screen.dart` import. Progress updates immediately on pop since event list refreshes in `_refresh()`. |
| `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R1-07:** Reset journey now calls `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(SplashScreen)` — clears entire nav stack, restarts from splash as if freshly installed. |

### Flow Change
```
BEFORE:
  Hub (parallax + single card) → event → "Witnessed" button → hub (stale) → tap → hub (updated)

AFTER:
  Event List (all events with progress) → tap → cinematic transition → event
  → "Continue" → pop → Event List (instantly refreshed, next event highlighted)
```

### Dead Code Created
- `lib/screens/aerial_hub_screen.dart` — no longer imported anywhere. Can be deleted in next cleanup.

## Sprint 16 — Gameplay Tutorial Overlay (R1-15)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R1-15

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/tutorial_overlay.dart` | NEW | Semi-transparent overlay (black 70%). 2-step sequential tutorial, tap anywhere to advance. Step 1: gamepad icon + "Use the joystick to move" + arrow pointing bottom-left (joystick area). Step 2: diamond icon + "Discover the glowing diamonds" + arrow pointing up (hotspot area). Step dots at bottom. "Tap to continue" prompt. Bilingual EN+AR. Fade in (400ms) / fade out (400ms). Marks `tutorialSeen` in prefs on completion. |
| `lib/services/prefs_service.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `tutorialSeen` key + getter/setter. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `_showTutorial` state. On first event (globalOrder == 1) + tutorial not seen → shows overlay before gameplay. On completion callback → hides overlay + starts idle timer. Rendered as top-level Stack child above settings overlay. |

### Tutorial Flow
```
First event, first time:
  Scene loads → tutorial overlay appears (blocks gameplay)
  → Step 1: "Use the joystick to move" [tap]
  → Step 2: "Discover the glowing diamonds" [tap]
  → Overlay fades out → gameplay begins → idle timer starts

Subsequent events / replays:
  No tutorial shown (tutorialSeen = true)
```

## Sprint 17 — Post-Event Flow Overhaul (R2-05, R2-06, R2-10)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R2-05, R2-06, R2-10

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-05:** Split `_continue()` into `_completeAndReturn()` (auto-completes on choice answer, shows XP snackbar, auto-pops after 3s) and `_continue()` (replay-only manual pop). "Continue the Journey" button removed for first-time play — event auto-completes when choice is answered. Button only shows on replays as "Back to Events". **R2-06:** Added `PopScope` wrapping Scaffold — on back press, saves `_discovered` set to `PrefsService.saveHotspotProgress()`. On init, loads saved progress and advances path position to match. Cleared on completion via `clearHotspotProgress()`. |
| `lib/services/prefs_service.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-06:** Added `saveHotspotProgress()`, `loadHotspotProgress()`, `clearHotspotProgress()` — persists discovered hotspot IDs per event as StringList. |
| `lib/screens/event_list_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-10:** Split `_openEvent()` — immersive events (with scene config) get cinematic transition → fly down. Flat events (no scene config) get direct fade transition, no cinematic. |

### Flow Change
```
BEFORE:
  Choice answered → "Continue the Journey" button → tap → pop (stale)
  → tap Play again → cinematic → "Witnessed" → tap → finally updates

AFTER:
  Choice answered → auto-complete + XP snackbar → 3s delay (read explanation)
  → auto-pop to event list (instantly updated, next event highlighted)
```

## Sprint 18 — Scene Animations + Hotspot Visibility (R2-02, R2-08, R2-09)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R2-02, R2-08, R2-09

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/scene_hotspot_marker.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-08:** Locked opacity 0.35→0.6. Border alpha 50→80. Added subtle glow BoxShadow for locked state. Icon color white38→white54. Locked hotspots now clearly visible against dark backgrounds. |
| `lib/data/scene_configs.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-02:** Event 1 particle alpha 0x35→0x80 (20%→50%), count 30→40. **R2-09:** Event 3 particle alpha 0x28→0x70 (16%→44%). Event 2 also boosted 0x30→0x70 for consistency. |
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/particle_painter.dart` | MODIFIED | Fixed alpha calculation — was using `baseColor.a * 255.0` with redundant rounding. Now uses clean `(baseColor.a * 255.0)` multiplication. |

## Sprint 19 — Event List Polish + UX (R2-01, R2-03, R2-07)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R2-01, R2-03, R2-07

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/event_list_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-01:** Added `◆ X/4` hotspot counter below location text for all events with scenes (reads saved progress from `PrefsService.loadHotspotProgress()`). Completed = green, in-progress = gold, untouched = muted. Play button restyled: gold filled background + glow BoxShadow + dark text (`AppColors.bg`) — stands out as clear CTA. Completed events show green check icon instead of text. **R2-07:** Wrapped in `PopScope` — back button shows bilingual "Exit game?" / "مغادرة اللعبة؟" confirmation dialog. Stay = dismiss, Exit = pop. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **R2-03:** Hotspot proximity radius increased from 0.07 to 0.09. Last hotspot triggers more reliably. |

## Sprint 20 — "Moment of Reflection" Enhancement (R2-04)
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Fixes:** R2-04

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `assets/audio/vo/vo_event*_q_*.mp3` | NEW (24 files) | Question VO for all 3 events x 4 voice variants. Generated with edge-tts (Syrian Arabic + British English). |
| `assets/audio/vo/vo_event*_exp_*.mp3` | NEW (included above) | Explanation/history records VO for all 3 events x 4 variants. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **VO:** Added `_choiceVoPath()` and `_playChoiceVo()` helpers. Question VO plays 500ms after choice phase starts. Explanation VO plays on answer selection. **Tutorial:** Added `_showChoiceTutorial` state. On first choice phase (`!isChoiceTutorialSeen`), shows dark overlay with: help icon, "A Moment of Reflection" title, explanation text ("You have witnessed the events. Now choose what you would do — then discover what history records."), tap to dismiss. Persists via `choiceTutorialSeen` pref. **Intro text:** Changed "A moment arrives." to "What would you do?" (bolder, clearer purpose). |
| `lib/services/prefs_service.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `choiceTutorialSeen` key + getter/setter. |

### Choice Phase Flow (After Fix)
```
All hotspots discovered → companion: "A moment of reflection approaches..."
  → choice tutorial overlay (first time only, tap to dismiss)
  → question text appears + question VO plays
  → user taps an answer → explanation reveals + explanation VO plays
  → 3s delay → event auto-completes + XP snackbar → auto-pop to event list
```

### Asset Count Update
- Choice VO: 24 MP3 files (3 events x 2 types x 4 variants)
- **Total VO files: 72** (48 fragment + 24 choice)
- **Total audio assets: 124** (72 VO + 52 companion)

## Sprint 21 — Branching System: Data Models + Safety Net
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/models/branch_point.dart` | NEW | `BranchPoint` (id, prompt EN+AR, optionA, optionB) and `BranchOption` (label EN+AR, targetHotspotId). Pure data models — no UI. |
| `lib/models/journey_event.dart` | MODIFIED | Added 3 optional fields: `anchorHotspotId`, `branchPoint`, `convergenceHotspotId`. Added `isBranching` getter (true when `branchPoint != null`). All fields default to null — backward compatible. Events 4-36 unchanged. |
| `lib/models/scene_config.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `pathWaypointsAlt` (optional alternate walking path for branch Option B). Defaults to null. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `_isBranching` getter — explicit safety guard for linear vs branching flow. Will be referenced in Sprint 22 scene controller logic. |
| `test/branching_test.dart` | NEW | 5 tests verifying: (1) All Events 4-36 have `isBranching == false`, (2) `isBranching` true only when branchPoint set, (3) `pathWaypointsAlt` null by default, (4) All non-E1/E2/E3 scene configs have no alt paths, (5) BranchPoint model stores all fields. **All 5 passed.** |

### Safety Net
```
if (event.branchPoint == null) → linear flow (Events 4–36 untouched)
if (event.branchPoint != null) → branching flow (Events 1–3 in Sprint 22+)
```
This guard is explicit from Sprint 21, not patched in later.

### Quality
- `flutter analyze` — zero errors, 1 expected warning (_isBranching unused until Sprint 22)
- `flutter test` — **5/5 passed**
- `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`

## Sprint 22 — Branching System: Card + Scene Controller
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/widgets/cinematic/branch_decision_card.dart` | NEW | Gold-pulsing bordered card overlay. Shows branch prompt (narrative text) + two tappable option buttons. Animated gold border (1800ms pulse cycle). Slide-in animation. ScrollView for long prompts. Styled to match discovery panel but signals "choice" via animated glow. |
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **State:** Added `_showBranchCard`, `_branchChoice`, `_branchUnlockOrder`. **Dismiss logic:** After anchor hotspot dismissed in branching mode → shows BranchDecisionCard instead of normal flow. **Branch handler:** `_onBranchSelected()` sets unlock order (anchor → chosen → other → convergence), swaps to alt path if Option B, recomputes segment lengths. **Path:** All `_scene.pathWaypoints` references replaced with `_activeWaypoints` getter (returns original or alt based on choice). **Hotspot unlock:** Branching-aware — uses `_branchUnlockOrder` to determine next active hotspot. Before choice: only anchor active. After choice: follows branch order. Linear events: unchanged (uses sequential index). **UI:** BranchDecisionCard rendered in Stack with dark overlay backdrop. |

### Branching Flow (Now Working)
```
Linear event (4+):    walk → hotspot 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → question  (UNCHANGED)
Branching event (1-3): walk → anchor → BRANCH CARD → chosen → other → convergence → question
                                        ↓                                    
                                   Path A or B selected, waypoints swap
```

### Safety
- `_isBranching` guard prevents branching logic from running on linear events
- All 5 branching safety tests still pass
- Events 4-36 completely untouched

### Quality
- `flutter analyze` — zero errors/warnings
- `flutter test` — **5/5 passed**

## Sprint 23 — Branching System: Wire All 3 Events
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/data/m1_data.dart` | MODIFIED | Added `BranchPoint` import. Wired branching fields for Events 1-3: anchor, convergence, branchPoint with full bilingual prompts + two options each. Events 4-36 untouched. |
| `lib/data/scene_configs.dart` | MODIFIED | **Convergence fragments:** Added transition lines to poet (E1), birds (E2), cloak (E3) — "Whether you X or Y — you have arrived at the same truth... And the question remains —". **Alt paths:** Added `pathWaypointsAlt` for all 3 events with reordered waypoints matching branch Option B. |
| `assets/audio/vo/` | REGENERATED | 12 convergence VO files regenerated with longer text (poet, birds, cloak x 4 variants). |

### Branching Roles
| Event | Anchor | Branch A | Branch B | Convergence |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| E1 Arabia | Ka'bah | Merchants | Idols | Poet |
| E2 Elephant | Army | Elephants | Muttalib | Birds |
| E3 Black Stone | Flood | Dispute | Al-Amin | Cloak |

## Sprint 24 — Branching System: In-Scene Question + Remove Moment of Reflection
**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Built
| File | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| `lib/screens/immersive_event_screen.dart` | MODIFIED | **New phase:** Added `_Phase.convergenceQuestion` to enum. **Dismiss logic:** After convergence hotspot dismissed in branching mode → transitions to `convergenceQuestion` phase (not `choose`). Linear events unchanged → still use `choose` phase. **In-scene question:** `_buildConvergenceQuestion()` — centered card overlay with dark backdrop. Shows "What would you do?" header, question text (Cinzel), tappable options, "History records..." explanation on answer. Same answer logic as linear (`_selectChoice` → `_completeAndReturn`). **Moment of Reflection eliminated:** `_buildChoiceOverlay` guarded by `!_isBranching` — branching events never see the old overlay. **Dim overlay + hotspot markers** updated to include `convergenceQuestion` phase. |

### Branching Event Flow (Complete)
```
Scene loads → all hotspots visible (locked)
  → walk to ANCHOR (only active hotspot) → discover fragment
  → BRANCH CARD appears (gold-pulsing, two choices)
  → user picks Option A or B → path swaps, next hotspot unlocks
  → walk to CHOSEN hotspot → discover fragment
  → OTHER hotspot unlocks → walk to it → discover fragment
  → CONVERGENCE hotspot unlocks → walk to it → discover fragment
    (includes transition line: "And the question remains —")
  → IN-SCENE QUESTION CARD slides up
    → user taps answer → explanation reveals + VO plays
    → 3s delay → auto-complete + XP → pop to event list
```

### Linear Event Flow (Unchanged — Events 4-36)
```
Scene loads → walk linearly → hotspot 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
  → "Moment of Reflection" overlay → full-screen question
  → answer → explanation → auto-complete → pop
```
